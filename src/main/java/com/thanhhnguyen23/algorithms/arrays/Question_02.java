/*
 * three number sum
 *
 * write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and and integer representing a target sum. the
 * function should find all triplets in the array that sum up to the target sum and return a two-dimensional array of
 * all these triplets. The numbers in each triplet should be ordered in ascending order, and the triplets themselves
 * should be ordered in ascending order with respect to the numbers they hold. If no three numbers sum up to the target
 * sum, the function should return an empty array.
 *
 *
 * sample input: [12,3,1,2,-6,5,-8,6], 0
 * sample output: [ [-8,2,6], [-8,3,5], [-6,1,5] ]
