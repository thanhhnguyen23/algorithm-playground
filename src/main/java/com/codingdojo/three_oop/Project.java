public class Project {
/*
You have been asked by a serial entrepreneur to create a class that she can use to create projects easily. She asks that each project has a name and a description. She needs to be able to create empty projects that she can add a name and description to later; projects with just a name; and projects with both. Every single project should be able to get and set both properties.
She also needs each project to be able to give an elevator pitch that will return the name and description separated by a colon.
Of course, you will also need to demo its capabilities for her, so make a ProjectTest class to do this.

Objectives:
        ● Practice overloading methods such as constructors.

        ● Implement getter and setters.

Tasks:
        ● Create a Project class that has the fields of name and description.

        ● Create an instance method called elevatorPitch that will return the name and description separated by a colon.

        ● Overload the constructor method in three different ways.

    public Project() {}

    public Project(String name) {}

    public Project(String name, String description) {}

        ● Create getter and setters for each field

        ● Create a ProjectTest file that will test all the functionality.

            Optional Challenges:
                    ● Add an additional initialCost member variable that is of type double and has both getters and setters

        ● Add this to the elevator pitch in parentheses after the name, e.g.: name (cost): description

        ● Create a Portfolio class that will keep an ArrayList of Projects in the field projects. Use generics to ensure these are Project objects.

                    ● Add the appropriate getters/setters/constructors for this class to work

        ● Add the getPortfolioCost method that calculates and returns the cost to buy the entire portfolio.

        ● Add the showPortfolio method that will print all the project elevator pitches, followed by the total cost.
