# how to solve problems in technical interview
## analytics skills
## coding skills
## technical skills
## communication skills

## good code
* readability
* time complexity - time efficient measured in Big-O notation
* space complexity - memory efficient measured in Big-O notation

## big o - measuring the scalability of code
* time efficient
* memory efficient

## data structures
* arrays
* trees
* stacks
* queues
* linked lists
* tries
* graphs
* hash tables

## algorithms
* sorting
* dynamic programming
* bfs + dfs (searching)
* recursion

## general problem solving summary
* what are the inputs/outputs?
* identify time, space, and memory constraints?
* start with brute force then explain this is not the best approach
* pseudocode 
* think about edge cases that might your code
* test your code
* once your code works, talk about future improvements that can be done
